# Animating and transforming

For this project I wanted to continue to build my skills with React. I used styled components for the CSS animations. 
I wanted to make my project interactive so I used useState and some Javascriptto be able to flip between states and make 
the project a bit more dynamic.

In the src folder you can find a Components folder with the two components: Ball and Text.

I had a lot of fun exploring the different animations and possibilites. For the text I am using keyframes to create a glitch animation that is
applied to an H1 with two spans attached.
